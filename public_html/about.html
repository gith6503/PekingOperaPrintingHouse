    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In today's environment, managing printing tasks can often become a 
        challenge for everyone. Currently, the manual process of printing involves physical submissions 
        and long queues, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. This proposal aims to introduce an online 
        printing system that allows users to submit print jobs remotely, track the status of their prints, and manage 
        their print quotas effortlessly.</p>
<p>The system will enable users to upload their documents for printing, set print preferences, and monitor the progress 
    of their print jobs online. The platform will be accessible through any device with internet connectivity,
    streamlining the process and eliminating the need for physical submission at print stations.
